# Bayesian Optimization with MNIST

This is a classification analysis project where I demonstrate exploratory data analysis as well as data preparation using PCA for dimensionality reduction. The main technique used in this project was hyperparameter optimization using the Tree of Parzen Estimators (TPE) approach with Hyperopt.
